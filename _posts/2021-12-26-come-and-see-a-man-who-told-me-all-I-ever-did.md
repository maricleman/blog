## Come and See a Man who Told me all That I Ever Did

George Muller understood this about life: people are not as impressed at what man can do for God, but what God can do through a man. That's how he lived his life. 

Muller built the orphanage on this principle. He writes in his journal not primarily about having compassion on orphans, but about being a display to a lost and dying world that God is real and that He really does work in supernatural ways. And so, George Muller was able to provide for over 10,000 orphans without ever asking or campaigning for support. He simply prayed.

I cannot help but ask: what can we learn from this saint who has gone before us? How impressed are people in your life when you display good, diligent, Christian character? What about when you display the grace and power of God in your life through your weakness?

# The Biblical Principle

Think about it. You can talk with your unbelieving neighbor about how consistently you go to church, how you take care of your family, or even how many volunteer hours you spend helping the homeless. And while all of that is fine and good, your unbelieving neighbor will likely think, "well isn't he put together!"

What if you boasted about your weakness -- like the Apostle Paul did? What if you shared stories with your neighbor or co-worker about how you personally have experienced the grace of God in your life?

I'm reminded of John 3:20-21: 
> "For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.”

There are two kinds of people according to John: those who hide their sinfulness and those that expose it. Not only that, but their motives are completely contrary. One loves to hide their sinfulness; the other loves to expose it so that *the works of God may be displayed in them.*

That phrase has always captured my attention and is worthy of much pondering. How can I witness about Christ in such a way that He is made great in my life, and I on the other hand am shown for who I really am.

It's no mistake in John's gospel in the next chapter we get an example of this -- the woman at the well. 

> "Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me all that I ever did.” 

This phrase: **all that I ever did** is part of this woman's testimony. The same woman who had 5 husbands and was now living with a man who was not her husband (John 4:18). The same woman who fetched water at the well when no one else was there, for fear that others would see her is *now shouting to all the townspeople to come and see a man who has exposed all that she has ever done*. What grace, what power! So amazed is she at the Christ that she no longer cares if others see her for who she is: a sinner. Surely, she has experienced what John 3:20-21 is describing. She has come into the light to display the works of God in her. 

# Let's Get Practical
And, my friend, the truth of the matter is: we should all be able to tell plenty of stories regarding how the grace of God has personally worked itself out in our life. May we be able to say to a lost and dying world: I am indeed a great sinner, and Jesus Christ is a mighty savior.

I remember the time I was confronted by an elder at my church over bitterness and unforgiveness towards my Mom and how the Lord worked in my heart over the next few months to reconcile us. I reached out to my Mom for the first time in *3 years* and humbled myself and asked for her forgiveness. I was in the wrong. My elder was right. By God's grace, he pointed out sin in my life that needed to be repented of. In God's providence, roughly a year later she suffered a hemorrhagic stroke and has never been the same since. I'm incredibly thankful that in God's providence an elder in my church confronted me when he did.

What stories do you have in your life that you can share that allow you to boast in your own weakness, meanwhile boasting in God's grace and strength? Perhaps you might share these stories with your unbelieving neighbor or co-worker in hopes that they might themselves encounter the risen Christ. May we invite others like the Samaritan woman did: "come and see a man who told me all that I ever did!"
