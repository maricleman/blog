## Come and See a Man who Told me all That I Ever Did

George Muller understood this about life: people are not as impressed at what man can do for God, but what God can do through a man. That's how he lived his life. 

Muller built the orphanage on this principle. He writes in his journals about displaying to others that God answers prayer, that He is real and He really does work in supernatural ways. George Muller was able to provide for over 10,000 orphans without ever asking or campaigning for support. He simply prayed.

I cannot help but ask: what can we learn from this saint who has gone before us?

# The Biblical Principle

George Muller's faith and prayer life is certainly inspiring, and there is much to ponder and glean from his life -- I can't possible cover it all in one blog post! I want to, however, hone in on one particular thought: how can we, like George Muller, demonstrate Christ's power through our weakness? 

Think about it. You can talk with your unbelieving neighbor about how consistently you go to church, how you take care of your family, or even how many volunteer hours you spend helping the homeless. And while all of that is fine and good, your unbelieving neighbor will likely think, "well isn't *he* put together!"

What if instead of you demonstrating what you do for God, you demonstrated how God is working through you -- in spite of your sinfulness, weaknesses, and failures? You'd have to do things like boast about your weakness, that Christ's strength may be magnified in you. You'd have to do things like expose your sinful tendencies and failures in order to show others how Christ has personally brought you out of darkness and into the light.

I'm reminded of John 3:20-21: 
> "For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.”

There are two kinds of people according to John: those who hide their sinfulness and those that expose it. Not only that, but their motives are completely different. One loves to hide their sinfulness; the other loves to expose it so that **the works of God may be displayed in them.**

It's no mistake in John's gospel in the next chapter we get an example of this -- the woman at the well.

After Jesus and the Samaritan woman finish conversing, the women testifies that Jesus is in fact the Messiah in John 4:39 in a rather peculiar manner:

> "Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me all that I ever did.” 

This phrase: **all that I ever did** is how this woman testifies to the Christ. The same woman who had 5 husbands and was now living with a man who was not her husband (John 4:18). The same woman who shamefully fetched water every day when one else was there is *now shouting to all the townspeople to come and see a man who has exposed all that she has ever done*. So amazed is she at the Christ that she no longer cares if others see her for who she is: a sinner. Surely she has experienced what John 3:20-21 is describing. She has come into the light to display the works of God in her. 

# Let's Get Practical
The truth of the matter is: we should all be able to tell plenty of stories regarding how the grace of God has personally worked itself out in our life.

I remember the time I was confronted by an elder at my church over bitterness and unforgiveness towards my Mom. I felt so justified in my anger towards my Mom over all that she had done to me growing up. Seething in my anger I had trampled over the gospel of grace. The Lord began to work in my heart to forgive my Mom, being convicted over my bitterness towards her. I reached out to my Mom after not talking with her for *3 years* and humbled myself and asked for her forgiveness. I was in the wrong. My elder was right. Jesus worked through my elder to reveal sin to me I was previously blind to. In God's gracious, good and sweet providence roughly a year later she suffered a hemorrhagic stroke and has never been the same since. My Mom's mental capacity has dimished to such a degree that I'm confident I could not have reconciled things after the stroke. I'm incredibly thankful that an elder in my church confronted me when he did.

What stories do you have in your life that you can share that allow you to boast in your own weakness, meanwhile boasting in God's grace and strength? Perhaps you might share these stories with your unbelieving neighbor or co-worker in hopes that they might themselves encounter the risen Christ. May we invite others like the Samaritan woman did: "come and see a man who told me all that I ever did!"
