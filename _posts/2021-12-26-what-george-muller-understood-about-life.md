## What George Muller Understood about life

George Muller understood this about life: people are not as impressed at what man can do for God, but what God can do through a man. That's how he lived his life. 

Muller built the orphanage on this principle. He writes in his journal not primarily about having compassion on orphans, but about being a display to a lost and dying world that God is real and that He really does work in supernatural ways. And so, George Muller was able to provide for over 10,000 orphans without ever asking or campaigning for support. He simply prayed.

I cannot help but think: is it not the same with our witness? How impressed are people in your life when you display good, diligent, Christian character? What about when you display the grace and power of God in your life through your weakness?

# The Biblical Principle

Think about it. You can talk with your unbelieving neighbor about how consistently you go to church, how you take care of your family, or even how many volunteer hours you spend on helping the homeless. And while all of that is fine and good, your unbelieving neighbor will likely think something to the tune of, "well isn't he put together."

Versus, what if you boasted about your weakness -- like the Apostle Paul did? What if you shared stories with your neighbor about how you personally have experienced the grace of God in your life?

I'm reminding of John 3:20-21: 
> "For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.‚Äù

There are two kinds of people according to John: those who hide their sinfulness and those that expose it. Not only that, but their motives are completely contrary. One loves to hide their sinfulness, the other loves to expose it so that *the works of God may be displayed in them.*

That phrase has always captured my attention and is worthy of much pondering. How can I witness about Christ in such a way that He is made great in my life, and I on the other hand am shown for who I really am.

# Let's Get Practical
And, my friend, the truth of the matter is: I can tell you plenty of stories regarding how the grace of God has personally worked itself out in my life. I am indeed a great sinner, and Jesus Christ is a mighty savior.

I remember the time was confronted by an elder at my church over bitterness and unforgiveness towards my Mom and how the Lord worked in my heart over the next few months to reconcile us. I reached out to my Mom for the first time in *3 years* and humbled myself and asked for her forgiveness. In God's providence, roughly a year later she suffered a hemorrhagic stroke and has never been the same since. I'm incredibly thankful that in God's providence an elder in my church confronted me exactly when he did.

What stories do you have in your life that you can share that allow you to boast in your own weakness, meanwhile boasting in God's grace and strength? Perhaps you might share these stories with your unbelieving neighbor or co-worker in hopes that they might themselves encounter the risen Christ.
