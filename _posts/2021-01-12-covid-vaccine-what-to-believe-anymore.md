## Idk what to believe anymore?

"I don't know what to believe anymore!" is a common phrase I heard nowadays from folks that I converse with on the topic on the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.

There's so many various, strong and conflicting opinions on the matter -- and, not just from politicians, but doctors, nurses, clinicians, etc.

What should we believe anymore? I just want the truth. 

This blog post is to attempt to answer that question. What should you believe anymore?

And let me start with this -- you should talk with your doctor.

Yes.

I'm tired of hearing folks wrestling with this who haven't spoken with their doctor. Stop letting your politicians and employer tell you what you should do medically and talk with your doctor, who actually has the credentials to talk wiht you about this topic.

Sounds too simple, right?
